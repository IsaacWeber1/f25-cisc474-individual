## 🟢 Completed Features

### 0. Infrastructure & Foundation ✅ COMPLETE
**Status**: Production operational
**Sessions**: Multiple (across different features)
**Location**: `/apps/docs/public/{planning,nestjs,supabase,switch_to_tanstack,connect_frontent_and_backend}/`

**What's Working**:
- ✅ TanStack Start frontend (deployed to Vercel)
- ✅ NestJS backend (deployed to Render)
- ✅ Supabase PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Prisma ORM with complete schema
- ✅ Turborepo monorepo structure
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)

- ✅ User synchronization (Auth0 → Database via /users/me)
- ✅ CORS configured for dev + production
- ✅ Database schema includes auth0Id field

**Known Issues**:
- ⚠️ Minor code quality issues documented in IMPLEMENTATION_AUDIT.md
- ⚠️ Hardcoded fallback URL in authFetcher.ts (low priority)

**Dependencies**: None
**Blocks**: All other features (need auth for testing)
**Next Steps**: Merge to main after Phase 1 complete

## 🔴 Blocked / On Hold

### 8. Testing Implementation ❌ CRITICAL DEBT
**Status**: Documented, not implemented
**Sessions**: 1 (documentation only)
**Location**: `/apps/docs/public/testing/`
**Estimated Time**: 26-32 hours

**Goal**: Achieve 80% test coverage across backend and frontend

**What Needs Implementation**:
- ❌ Backend unit tests (Jest + Supertest)
  - Services: Users, Courses, Assignments, Submissions, Grades
  - Controllers: All endpoints
  - Guards: JWT validation, role checks
- ❌ Frontend component tests (Vitest + Testing Library)
  - Auth components (LoginButton, LogoutButton, RequireAuth)
  - Route components (courses, assignments, submissions, grades)
- ❌ E2E tests (Playwright)
  - Login flow
  - Student submit → TA grade → Student view feedback
  - Reflection creation and submission
  - Course and assignment creation

**Current State**:
- ✅ Testing strategy documented (4,299 lines)
- ✅ Tools selected (Jest, Vitest, Playwright, MSW)
- ✅ 30+ code examples provided
- ❌ Zero tests implemented

**Dependencies**:
- 🟡 ALL features (BLOCKED - need features before testing)

**Blocks**: Production deployment, assignment completion

**Priority**: ONGOING - Should write tests alongside each feature

**Strategy**:
- Write unit tests per feature during implementation (not after)
- Create E2E tests for complete workflows
- Target: 80% unit, 70% integration, 100% E2E critical paths

---

### 9. Analytics & Admin ⏸️ FUTURE
**Status**: Future enhancement
**Sessions**: 0
**Location**: Not yet planned
**Estimated Time**: 6-8 hours

**Goal**: Administrative features and analytics dashboards

**Ideas**:
- Activity logs dashboard
- Grade distribution analytics
- Skill tag trending (which skills students identify most)
- Submission pattern analysis (when do students submit?)
- User management interface

**Dependencies**: All core features complete

**Priority**: #8 - Nice to have, not required for class

---

## 📋 Coordination Strategy

### Sequential Code Implementation

**Pattern**: One feature branch at a time (avoid merge conflicts)

```
Week 1:  [========== Submissions Implementation ==========]
Week 2:  [========== Grades Implementation ==========]
Week 3:  [========== Comments Implementation ==========]
Week 4:  [========== Testing Implementation ==========]
```

### Parallel Documentation Planning

**Pattern**: Write planning docs for next feature while coding current

```
Week 1:  [Submissions Code]
         [= Grades Planning Docs =]

Week 2:  [Grades Code]
         [= Comments Planning Docs =]
```

### Branch Strategy

```bash
# Current state
main                           # Production, protected
feat/auth0-authentication      # Ready to merge (10 sessions complete)

# Upcoming branches (create sequentially)
feat/submissions               # Week 1-2
feat/grades                    # Week 2-3
feat/comments                  # Week 3
feat/courses                   # Week 4
feat/enrollments              # Week 4-5
feat/reflections              # Week 5-6
feat/testing                  # Ongoing throughout
```

## 🎯 Critical Path

**To make system functional** (Phase 1):
1. ✅ Authentication (COMPLETE)
2. ⏳ Submissions (4-6 hours) ← START HERE
3. ⏳ Grades (3-4 hours)
4. ⏳ Comments (2-3 hours)

**Phase 1 Total**: 9-13 hours
**Result**: Students can submit, TAs can grade, everyone can discuss

---

**To complete assignment** (All phases):
1. Phase 1: Core workflows (9-13 hours)
2. Phase 2: Course management (6-8 hours)
3. Phase 3: Reflections (8-10 hours)
4. Phase 4: Testing (26-32 hours)
5. Phase 5: Polish (6-8 hours)

**Total**: 55-71 hours
**Already Invested**: 8.5 hours (auth + planning)
**Remaining**: 46-62 hours

## 📚 Documentation Standards

### Per-Feature Documentation

Each feature must have:
```
features/{feature_name}/
├── README.md                  # Overview, quick reference
├── CURRENT_STATE.md           # Handoff document with 🔴 marker
├── planning/
│   └── IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md # Step-by-step guide
├── architecture/              # How it works (optional)
└── sessions/
    ├── 001_planning/
    │   └── CHECKPOINT.md
    └── 002_implementation/
        └── CHECKPOINT.md
```

### Session Checkpoints

Create checkpoint at:
- Natural stopping points (2+ hours of work)
- Before switching features
- When encountering blockers
- End of work sessions

### CURRENT_STATE.md Updates

Update after EVERY session:
- Mark what's complete (✅)
- Document known issues (❌)
- Update work remaining
- Move 🔴 marker to next priority
