---

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

1. **Read this file** (2 minutes)
2. **Skim DOCUMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** (5 minutes)  
3. **Bookmark DOCUMENTATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** (for daily use)
4. **When needed**, read relevant sections of REGASSIST_DOCUMENTATION_PATTERNS.md

---

## Typical Workflow

### When Starting a New Feature
```bash
# Step 1: Check what exists
ls apps/docs/public/{feature_name}/

# Step 2: If exists, read CURRENT_STATE.md
cat apps/docs/public/{feature_name}/CURRENT_STATE.md

# Step 3: If doesn't exist, create minimum structure
mkdir -p apps/docs/public/{feature_name}/{planning,sessions}

# Step 4: Copy templates from DOCUMENTATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
# Create:
#   - README.md
#   - CURRENT_STATE.md
#   - sessions/001_planning/CHECKPOINT.md
```

### After Work Session (Every 30+ minutes)
```bash
# Step 1: Update CURRENT_STATE.md with current status
# Step 2: Create/update session checkpoint
# Step 3: Commit changes
git add apps/docs/public/{feature_name}/
git commit -m "docs({feature_name}): session NNN checkpoint"

# Step 4: Next session, read CURRENT_STATE.md first
```

## Key Concepts

### CURRENT_STATE.md
- **The source of truth** for feature status
- Updated after every session
- Tells you what works, what doesn't, how to verify, what's next
- Replaces "read conversation history"

### Sessions
- Natural work breakpoints (30-120 minutes)
- Numbered sequentially (001, 002, 003...)
- Each gets a CHECKPOINT.md
- Numbers always increment (never reuse)

### Checkpoints
- What you did in the session
- What worked
- What broke and how you fixed it
- Next steps

### Architecture Files
- For complex features only
- Document design decisions BEFORE coding
- Keep updated as design evolves

## Real Examples in RegAssist

All examples are real, working systems:

```
/Users/owner/Projects/regassist_project/
├── documents/current/bi_system/           (47 sessions!)
│   ├── README.md                          ← Copy this structure
│   ├── CURRENT_STATE.md                   ← Excellent example
│   ├── planning/mvp_plan.md               ← Real planning doc
│   └── sessions/                          ← See progression
├── documents/current/user_roles/          (Medium feature)
│   ├── README.md                          ← Medium complexity
│   └── CURRENT_STATE.md                   ← Good format
└── documents/current/cicd_pipeline/       (47+ sessions)
    └── sessions/                          ← See how sessions grow
```

**All public reference material** - you can copy directly!

## File Organization in Your Project

After implementing this system, you'll have:

```
apps/docs/public/
├── assignments/                         (feature docs)
│   ├── README.md                       (overview)
│   ├── CURRENT_STATE.md               (status)
│   ├── planning/
│   │   └── planning.md                (requirements)
│   ├── architecture/
│   │   └── architecture.md            (design)
│   └── sessions/
│       ├── 001_planning/CHECKPOINT.md
│       ├── 002_crud_implementation/CHECKPOINT.md
│       ├── 003_testing/CHECKPOINT.md
│       └── ...
├── other_feature/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── CURRENT_STATE.md
│   └── sessions/...
└── README_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md        (this file)
```

## Why This System Works

### Problem It Solves
- Context is lost between work sessions
- Architecture decisions are scattered
- Collaboration is difficult without written record
- New team members need clear onboarding

### Solution
1. **CURRENT_STATE.md** is single source of truth
2. **Sessions** create clear work breakpoints
3. **Checkpoints** document what happened and why
4. **Architecture docs** capture design decisions upfront

### Proof It Works
- RegAssist uses it across 15+ concurrent features
- Some features have 47+ sessions (months of work)
- BI System: 9000+ lines of planning/architecture docs
- CI/CD Pipeline: Dozens of complex decisions documented

## Common Questions

**Q: How long does this take?**
A: Setup is 15 minutes per feature. Ongoing is 5 minutes per session.

**Q: Do I really need to update CURRENT_STATE.md after every session?**
A: Yes. It's the only way to prevent context loss.

**Q: Can I skip architecture for simple features?**
A: No architecture.md needed for simple fixes. README + CURRENT_STATE are required.

**Q: Why numbered sessions instead of dates?**
A: Creates clear timeline. Session 005 always follows 004. Dates change, numbers don't.

**Q: Can I reuse session numbers?**
A: No. Session 006 must come after 005. Never restart numbering.

**Q: How do I know when to create a checkpoint?**
A: After 30 minutes of work, or when making significant progress, or when context switching.

**Q: What if documentation seems excessive?**
A: Try it for one feature (2-3 sessions). You'll see the ROI immediately.

## Next Steps

1. **Choose a feature** to document (can be work in progress)
2. **Create minimum structure** (README + CURRENT_STATE + sessions/001)
3. **Copy templates** from DOCUMENTATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
4. **Fill in your feature details**
5. **Use CURRENT_STATE.md as your starting point next session**

## Files You Have

1. **README_DOCUMENTATION_GUIDE.md** (this file) - Navigation
2. **DOCUMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Overview & why it works
3. **DOCUMENTATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Templates & checklists
4. **REGASSIST_DOCUMENTATION_PATTERNS.md** - Complete reference
