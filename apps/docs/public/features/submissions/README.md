## Key Features

**Target Functionality**:
- ‚úÖ View existing submissions (GET operations working)
- ‚ùå Create draft submissions (POST /submissions)
- ‚ùå Update draft submissions (PATCH /submissions/:id)
- ‚ùå Submit for grading (POST /submissions/:id/submit)
- ‚ùå Delete submissions (DELETE /submissions/:id)
- ‚ùå File upload handling
- ‚ùå Due date validation
- ‚ùå Submission type validation

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Authentication system operational
- ‚úÖ Database schema includes Submission model
- ‚úÖ Prisma client generated

### Implementation Steps

1. **Generate NestJS Components** (2 min)
   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   npx nest g module submissions
   npx nest g controller submissions --no-spec
   npx nest g service submissions --no-spec
   ```

2. **Create DTOs** (15 min)
   ```bash
   mkdir -p src/submissions/dto
   # Create CreateSubmissionDto and UpdateSubmissionDto
   ```

3. **Implement Service** (2-3 hours)
   - create() - Create draft submission
   - update() - Update draft (with ownership check)
   - submit() - Transition DRAFT ‚Üí SUBMITTED
   - delete() - Remove submission (with validation)

4. **Add Controller Endpoints** (1 hour)
   - POST /submissions - @UseGuards(AuthGuard('jwt'))
   - PATCH /submissions/:id - With ownership validation
   - POST /submissions/:id/submit - Final submission
   - DELETE /submissions/:id - With safety checks

5. **Test** (30 min)
   - Manual testing with curl + JWT token
   - Verify ownership checks
   - Test status transitions
   - Validate error handling

## Architecture Summary

### Database Model
```prisma
model Submission {
  id            String           @id @default(cuid())
  type          AssignmentType   // FILE, TEXT, REFLECTION
  content       String?          // For TEXT submissions
  files         Json?            // For FILE submissions (array of metadata)
  status        SubmissionStatus @default(DRAFT) // DRAFT, SUBMITTED, GRADED
  submittedAt   DateTime?

  // Relations
  assignmentId  String
  assignment    Assignment       @relation(...)
  studentId     String
  student       User             @relation(...)
  grade         Grade?
  comments      Comment[]
}

enum SubmissionStatus {
  DRAFT
  SUBMITTED
  GRADED
}
```

### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| GET | /submissions | ‚úÖ | List user's submissions |
| GET | /submissions/:id | ‚úÖ | Get submission details |
| POST | /submissions | ‚úÖ | Create draft submission |
| PATCH | /submissions/:id | ‚úÖ | Update draft submission |
| POST | /submissions/:id/submit | ‚úÖ | Submit for grading |
| DELETE | /submissions/:id | ‚úÖ | Delete submission |

### Status Transitions

```
DRAFT ‚îÄ‚îÄsubmit()‚îÄ‚îÄ> SUBMITTED ‚îÄ‚îÄgrade()‚îÄ‚îÄ> GRADED
  ‚îÇ                                           ‚îÇ
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄdelete()‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄX                            ‚îî‚îÄ(cannot delete)
```

## Current Status

**Phase**: Not started
**Priority**: ‚≠ê #1 HIGHEST - Unblocks student workflow
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
**Dependencies**:
- ‚úÖ Authentication (COMPLETE)
- ‚úÖ Database schema (COMPLETE)

**Blocks**:
- Grades (need submissions to grade)
- Comments (need submissions to comment on)
- Reflections (special submission type)
