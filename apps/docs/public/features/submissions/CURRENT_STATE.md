# Current State - Submissions Feature

*Last Updated: 2025-10-24 (Feature not yet started)*

---

## What's Working

**Read Operations**:
- ‚úÖ GET /submissions - Returns all submissions for authenticated user
- ‚úÖ GET /submissions/:id - Returns single submission with details
- ‚úÖ Database schema complete with Submission model
- ‚úÖ Seed data populated (5 example submissions in database)
- ‚úÖ Frontend can display existing submissions

**Related Systems**:
- ‚úÖ Authentication system operational (JWT tokens working)
- ‚úÖ User synchronization from Auth0 to database
- ‚úÖ Assignment model complete (submissions reference assignments)

---

## Known Issues

**Missing Write Operations**:
- ‚ùå Cannot create submissions (no POST endpoint)
- ‚ùå Cannot update submissions (no PATCH endpoint)
- ‚ùå Cannot submit for grading (no status transition)
- ‚ùå Cannot delete submissions (no DELETE endpoint)
- ‚ùå No file upload handling
- ‚ùå No validation for due dates or assignment types

**Frontend Gaps**:
- ‚ùå No submission creation form
- ‚ùå No file upload component
- ‚ùå No draft saving functionality
- ‚ùå No submit button with confirmation

---

## Work Remaining

**Backend Implementation**:
- [ ] Generate NestJS module, controller, service (if needed)
- [ ] Create DTOs (CreateSubmissionDto, UpdateSubmissionDto)
- [ ] Implement create() service method with validation
- [ ] Implement update() service method with ownership check
- [ ] Implement submit() service method for status transition
- [ ] Implement delete() service method with safety checks
- [ ] Add guards to all endpoints (@UseGuards(AuthGuard('jwt')))
- [ ] File upload middleware (multer or similar)
- [ ] Due date validation logic
- [ ] Assignment type validation

**Frontend Implementation**:
- [ ] Create submission form component
- [ ] File upload interface (drag-and-drop optional)
- [ ] Draft auto-save functionality
- [ ] Submit confirmation dialog
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Loading states during API calls

**Testing**:
- [ ] Manual testing with curl + JWT token
- [ ] Ownership validation tests
- [ ] Status transition tests
- [ ] File upload tests (if implemented)
- [ ] Unit tests for service methods
- [ ] E2E tests for submission flow

## üî¥ NEXT SESSION START HERE

### Current Situation
- Feature not started
- Planning documentation complete
- Database and authentication ready
- Clear implementation path established

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Create branch: `git checkout -b feat/submissions`
2. Generate NestJS components (module, controller, service)
3. Create DTOs for create and update operations
4. Implement create() service method (start with basic version)
5. Add POST /submissions endpoint with authentication guard
6. Test with curl and JWT token

### What's Complete
- ‚úÖ Database schema designed and migrated
- ‚úÖ Authentication system protecting endpoints
- ‚úÖ GET operations working (can view submissions)
- ‚úÖ Planning documentation written

### What's NOT Complete
- ‚ùå All write operations (POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- ‚ùå File upload handling
- ‚ùå Frontend submission forms
- ‚ùå Testing implementation

**Estimated Time to Complete**: 4-6 hours
**Priority**: ‚≠ê #1 HIGHEST - Critical path blocker
**Status**: üü° PLANNING COMPLETE - Ready to implement
