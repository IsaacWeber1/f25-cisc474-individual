# TanStack Architecture Improvement - Current State
<!-- UPDATE THIS FILE AT THE END OF EACH SESSION -->
<!-- MANDATORY: Update this file when creating new checkpoints -->

**Last Updated:** October 10, 2025 (Session 001 - Initial Planning Complete)
**System Status:** üìã PLANNING PHASE - Ready for Implementation

## Quick Orientation

### What is This Project?
Comprehensive architectural refactoring to eliminate technical debt in the TanStack Start application, making it maintainable, debuggable, and scalable.

### Current Phase
**Pre-Implementation** - Planning and architecture design complete, ready for Phase 1 implementation

## üî¥ NEXT SESSION START HERE

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Review and approve architecture proposal**
   - Read `output/ARCHITECTURE_PROPOSAL.md`
   - Get stakeholder sign-off on timeline and approach

2. **Set up development workflow**
   - Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/architecture-refactor`
   - Ensure lint and build pass: `npm run lint && npm run build`

3. **Begin Phase 1 - Quick Wins** (2-4 hours):
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Create constants file
   touch src/config/constants.ts

   # Step 2: Create Auth Context
   touch src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx

   # Step 3: Create shared components
   mkdir -p src/components/common
   touch src/components/common/{LoadingSpinner,ErrorMessage,PageLayout}.tsx
   ```

4. **Follow Quick Wins Guide**:
   - See `guides/QUICK_WINS.md` for step-by-step instructions
   - Complete items 1-4 (constants, auth, shared components, route constants)
   - Test after each change
   - Commit incrementally

### What's Complete
- ‚úÖ Technical debt audit (found 396 inline styles, 9 hardcoded IDs, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Root cause analysis (why debugging was hard)
- ‚úÖ Architecture design (3-phase plan with component structure)
- ‚úÖ Impact assessment (before/after metrics)
- ‚úÖ Implementation roadmap (6-week phased approach)
- ‚úÖ Documentation structure created (README, guides, architecture docs)
- ‚úÖ Quick wins guide (immediate improvements)

### What's NOT Complete
- ‚ùå Stakeholder approval for timeline
- ‚ùå Any code refactoring
- ‚ùå Constants file creation
- ‚ùå Auth context implementation
- ‚ùå Shared component extraction
- ‚ùå CSS system setup
- ‚ùå Testing of refactored code

## Work Completed (by session)

### Session 001 - Initial Planning and Analysis (2025-10-10)
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Focus**: Problem analysis, architecture design, documentation creation

**Accomplishments**:
1. **Comprehensive Audit**:
   - Found 396 inline styles across all route files
   - Identified 9 instances of hardcoded user ID
   - Counted 5+ duplicate loading spinner implementations
   - Documented 10+ duplicate error handling implementations

## Work Remaining

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Eliminate hardcoded values, establish patterns

- [ ] Create `src/config/constants.ts`
  - [ ] CURRENT_USER_ID constant
  - [ ] API_ENDPOINTS object
  - [ ] ROUTE_PATHS object
  - [ ] COLORS design tokens
  - [ ] SPACING design tokens

- [ ] Create `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
  - [ ] AuthProvider component
  - [ ] useAuth() hook
  - [ ] CurrentUser type
  - [ ] Replace all 9 hardcoded user IDs

- [ ] Extract shared components
  - [ ] LoadingSpinner.tsx (replace 5+ duplicates)
  - [ ] ErrorMessage.tsx (replace 10+ duplicates)
  - [ ] PageLayout.tsx (standardize structure)

- [ ] Create `src/config/routes.ts`
  - [ ] Route path constants
  - [ ] Type-safe route builder functions
  - [ ] Update all 17+ route string references

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Zero hardcoded user IDs in route files
- ‚úÖ One LoadingSpinner implementation
- ‚úÖ One ErrorMessage implementation
- ‚úÖ All routes use constants
- ‚úÖ Lint and build still pass

### Phase 2: Maintainability (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Consistent styling, reusable logic

- [ ] Install and configure Tailwind CSS
  - [ ] Run `npm install tailwindcss`
  - [ ] Configure `tailwind.config.js`
  - [ ] Create `src/styles/theme.ts` with design tokens

- [ ] Remove inline styles (396 instances)
  - [ ] Convert to Tailwind classes
  - [ ] Use design tokens from theme.ts
  - [ ] Track progress: 0/396 removed

- [ ] Extract data hooks
  - [ ] `hooks/useCourse.ts`
  - [ ] `hooks/useUser.ts`
  - [ ] `hooks/useAssignments.ts`
  - [ ] `hooks/useGrades.ts`

- [ ] Add ESLint rules
  - [ ] No inline styles allowed
  - [ ] Require Link imports for navigation
  - [ ] Enforce import order

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Zero inline style objects
- ‚úÖ All colors from theme.ts
- ‚úÖ Data logic in hooks, not routes
- ‚úÖ ESLint enforces patterns

### Phase 3: Architecture (Week 5-6)
**Goal**: Scalable, professional structure

- [ ] Thin route files (< 150 lines each)
  - [ ] Extract components from each route
  - [ ] Move rendering to components
  - [ ] Keep only composition in routes

- [ ] Build component library
  - [ ] course/* components (Header, Nav, Stats, etc.)
  - [ ] assignment/* components
  - [ ] grade/* components
  - [ ] reflection/* components

- [ ] Add advanced patterns
  - [ ] Error boundaries
  - [ ] Suspense for loading
  - [ ] Code splitting

- [ ] Write documentation
  - [ ] Component API docs
  - [ ] Architecture decision records
  - [ ] Developer onboarding guide

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ All route files < 150 lines
- ‚úÖ Reusable component library
- ‚úÖ Professional code structure
- ‚úÖ Easy for new developers to understand

## Key Decisions Made

‚úÖ **Use Tailwind CSS** over CSS Modules (faster, more flexible)
‚úÖ **Use React Context** for auth (simpler than Redux for this scale)
‚úÖ **Use custom hooks** for data fetching (cleaner than inline useQuery)
‚úÖ **Three-phase approach** (critical ‚Üí maintainability ‚Üí architecture)
‚úÖ **Incremental refactoring** (don't rewrite everything at once)
‚úÖ **Test after every change** (ensure nothing breaks)

## Open Questions

1. **Timeline approval?** - Is 6-week timeline acceptable?
2. **Breaking changes?** - Can we change component APIs?
3. **Dark mode?** - Should we plan for theming now or later?
4. **Testing strategy?** - Add unit tests during refactor?
5. **Performance budget?** - Are we monitoring bundle size?

## Testing Status

**Current**:
- ‚úÖ Build passes
- ‚úÖ Lint has 11 TypeScript strict warnings (non-blocking)
- ‚úÖ All navigation working
- ‚ùå No unit tests exist

**After Phase 1**:
- Should have same test status
- All existing functionality working
- No regressions

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt (Pre-Refactor)
1. **396 inline styles** - No design consistency
2. **9 hardcoded user IDs** - No testing flexibility
3. **5+ duplicate loading spinners** - Inconsistent UX
4. **10+ duplicate error handlers** - Inconsistent behavior
5. **17+ hardcoded routes** - No type safety
6. **No central config** - Everything scattered
7. **576-line route files** - Mixed concerns
8. **No shared components** - Massive duplication

### Blockers
- None currently (planning phase)

## Environment Configuration

### Current Environment
```bash
# Working directory
cd /Users/owner/Assignments/Advanced\ Web\ Tech/f25-cisc474-individual/apps/web-start
