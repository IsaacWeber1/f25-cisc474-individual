Policy on AI: Students are free to use AI tools (e.g., Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT) as they see fit to enhance their learning. However, you are discouraged from becoming reliant on these tools, since incorrect usage can actually damage your learning. If you are not sure how to achieve something without AI, then you should be sure to aggressively pursue that understanding. Ask follow-up questions, talking to a human if that is helpful.

You are responsible for all code that you commit or submit. If you are asked about that code, you must be able to explain it. Failure to explain it will negatively impact your grade. Do not submit code that you do not understand. Get explanations of the code and concepts.

AI usage should be fully documented where applicable.
