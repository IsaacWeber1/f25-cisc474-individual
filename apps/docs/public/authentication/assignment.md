You need to add authentication to your app, and protect all of your backend endpoints from unauthenticated users.

You'll use Passport in NestJS to provide support for Auth0. This will require some careful coordination of your frontend and backend.

Here's my notes from doing the changes myself: https://github.com/acbart/cisc474-f25-individual-project-starter?tab=readme-ov-file#changes-on-october-19-2025Links to an external site.

I'll be going over all this in class on Monday. Please be there and pay attention!

We'll do demos in class on Friday to make sure you have everything working!
