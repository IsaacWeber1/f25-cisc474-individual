# üî¥ CRITICAL: Frontend Authentication Integration Issues

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Severity**: CRITICAL - All data fetching is broken
**Impact**: 100% of pages that fetch data are failing

## Executive Summary

After securing all backend endpoints with JWT authentication, the frontend is completely broken because it's not sending authentication tokens with API requests.

## Root Cause

1. **Backend**: All endpoints now require JWT authentication ‚úÖ (Working correctly)
2. **Frontend**: Using `backendFetcher` which doesn't include JWT tokens ‚ùå
3. **Solution Available**: `authFetcher` exists but isn't being used

## Current State

### What's Broken

| Route | Issue | File |
|-------|-------|------|
| `/courses` | 401 Unauthorized | `courses.tsx` uses `backendFetcher` |
| `/users` | 401 Unauthorized | `users.tsx` uses `backendFetcher` |
| `/profile` | 401 Unauthorized | `profile.tsx` uses `backendFetcher` |
| `/course/:id/*` | 401 Unauthorized | All course routes use `backendFetcher` |
| `/api-demo` | 401 Unauthorized | Uses `backendFetcher` |

### Files That Need Fixing

```bash
# All these files use backendFetcher instead of authFetcher:
apps/web-start/src/routes/courses.tsx
apps/web-start/src/routes/users.tsx
apps/web-start/src/routes/profile.tsx
apps/web-start/src/routes/api-demo.tsx
apps/web-start/src/routes/course.$id.tsx
apps/web-start/src/routes/course.$id.assignments.tsx
apps/web-start/src/routes/course.$id.grades.tsx
apps/web-start/src/routes/course.$id.reflections.tsx
# ... and more
```

## The Fix Required

### Current (Broken) Code
```typescript
import { backendFetcher } from '../integrations/fetcher';

// This doesn't include JWT tokens!
useQuery({
  queryKey: ['courses'],
  queryFn: backendFetcher<Array<Course>>('/courses'),
});
```

### Required Fix
```typescript
import { useAuthFetcher } from '../integrations/authFetcher';

// This includes JWT tokens!
const authFetcher = useAuthFetcher();
useQuery({
  queryKey: ['courses'],
  queryFn: () => authFetcher<Array<Course>>('/courses'),
});
```

## Impact Analysis

### User Experience
- **Login**: User can login via Auth0 ‚úÖ
- **View Data**: Cannot view any data (courses, assignments, etc.) ‚ùå
- **Error Messages**: Getting 401 errors on every page ‚ùå
- **Navigation**: Can navigate but pages show errors ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Technical Impact
- All TanStack Query calls fail with 401
- Console fills with authentication errors
- No data displays on any page
- Loading states followed by error states

## Testing Evidence

```bash
# Backend correctly rejects unauthenticated requests:
curl http://localhost:3000/courses
# Result: {"message":"Unauthorized","statusCode":401} ‚úÖ

# Frontend doesn't send tokens:
# Check Network tab in browser - no Authorization headers
```

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Update All Components (Recommended)
- Replace `backendFetcher` with `authFetcher` in all components
- Estimated files to change: ~15-20
- Time: 30-60 minutes

### Option 2: Modify backendFetcher
- Update `backendFetcher` to include auth tokens
- Single file change
- Risk: May break non-authenticated routes

### Option 3: Selective Protection
- Remove guards from read-only endpoints
- Keep guards only on write operations
- Risk: Reduces security

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Choose solution approach**
2. **Update all affected components**
3. **Test each route after fixing**
4. **Verify JWT tokens in Network tab**

## Why This Happened

This is a common integration issue when adding authentication:
1. Backend secured first ‚úÖ
2. Frontend not updated to match ‚ùå
3. Two different fetcher implementations exist
4. Wrong fetcher being used throughout

## Verification Steps

After fixing:
1. Open browser DevTools Network tab
2. Navigate to `/courses`
3. Check request headers for `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
4. Verify 200 OK response
5. Data should display

## Lessons Learned

1. **Coordinate Changes**: Backend and frontend auth must be updated together
2. **Single Fetcher**: Should have one auth-aware fetcher, not two
3. **Test Integration**: Always test frontend after backend changes
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Could have left some endpoints public initially

## Status

üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Application is non-functional for authenticated users

This must be fixed before the Friday demo!
