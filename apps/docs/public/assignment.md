Vision: To create a flexible, user-friendly, and scalable Learning Management System that empowers learners, instructors, and administrators by providing a structured yet adaptable environment for managing programming problems structured around courses, assignments, submissions, and feedback. The LMS will support diverse learning needs, streamline administrative processes, and foster meaningful engagement between all roles in the system. You'll also need to add some kind of cool feature for a unique submission type.

Create all of the following REQUIRED PIECES:

*   Requirements document outlining what different users need to be able to do (I recommend writing some user stories)
*   Site map identifying the frontend pages
*   Wireframes of some of the major screens
*   Basic data model diagram, at least identifying major nouns in the system

Yes, you may use chatgpt to help you do this. You can also compare and contrast with your neighbors. But you can't just submit exactly what someone else has, that is the actual line.

I am not looking for specific structure or exact format. There are many ways to make diagrams and documents that satisfy what I have written here. I am flexible, but I do expect clear information to be presented that satisfies the goal: give me a clear indication of what your web application will look like, such that you can start actually developing pieces of it.

All of your files should be written in the the apps/docs/public/ folder of your site. I recommend Markdown and Mermaid files. Images/PDFs are fine ONLY if they are easily readable. If I can't make heads or tails of your diagram, then it will be rejected.

Submit a direct link to a single Markdown file in your github repo that links to all the files that you create. If the files do not have an obvious one-to-one mapping for the REQUIRED PIECES, then make sure to describe the mapping. Make sure you are linking to the github repo, not to the deployed site.
