# Learning Management System - Project Documentation

## Vision
To create a flexible, user-friendly, and scalable Learning Management System that empowers learners, instructors, and administrators by providing a structured yet adaptable environment for managing programming problems structured around courses, assignments, submissions, and feedback. The LMS will support diverse learning needs, streamline administrative processes, and foster meaningful engagement between all roles in the system. 

**Unique Feature:** Interactive coding submission types where students can submit runnable code snippets with embedded test cases that professors/teaching assistants can execute directly within the LMS.

## Implementation Readiness

These documents provide a comprehensive foundation for development, including:

‚úÖ **Clear user requirements** with detailed user stories  
‚úÖ **Complete site navigation** with page-by-page specifications  
‚úÖ **Visual layouts** showing the user interface design  
‚úÖ **Database design** ready for implementation  
‚úÖ **Unique feature specification** for interactive code submissions  
‚úÖ **Scalability considerations** for future growth  

The planning phase establishes a solid foundation to begin developing the Learning Management System with confidence in the architecture and user experience design.
