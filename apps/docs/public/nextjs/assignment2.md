Read over the following NextJS doc pages:

*   [Project Structure](./project_structure.md)
*   [Layouts and Pages](./layouts_and_pages.md)
*   [Linking and Navigating](./linking_and_navigating.md)
*   [Server and Client Components](./server_and_client_components.md)

Then start developing the frontend of your website based on your [designs](../planning/planning.md).

I want to see at least 5 pages that link to each other.

Submit a link to the deployed page on Vercel.

Just to be clear, you should be developing the pages for your Individual Web Application (the LMS).
