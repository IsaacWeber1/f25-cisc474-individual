## 🟡 Current Functional Status

### What Works Now (You Can Test in Browser)

#### ✅ Login & Authentication
1. Visit http://localhost:3001
2. Click "Log In" → redirects to Auth0
3. Login with test credentials
4. Redirects back with user info displayed

#### ✅ View Courses
- Navigate to `/courses`
- See 3 courses with enrollment counts
- View course details with assignments

#### ✅ View Assignments
- See all assignments for courses
- View due dates and descriptions
- See assignment types (FILE, TEXT, REFLECTION)

#### ✅ View Submissions (Read-Only)
- See existing submissions
- View submission status (DRAFT, SUBMITTED, GRADED)
- View associated grades

#### ✅ View Grades (Read-Only)
- See grades with scores and feedback
- View grade history (audit trail)
- See who graded each submission

### ❌ What Doesn't Work Yet

#### Critical Workflows Blocked:
1. **Students cannot submit work** - No POST /submissions
2. **TAs cannot grade** - No POST /grades
3. **No feedback mechanism** - No POST /comments
4. **Professors cannot create courses** - No POST /courses
5. **Cannot update submissions** - No PATCH /submissions
6. **No reflection system** - Missing controllers

 🎯 Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Enable Core Workflows (Week 1)
**Goal**: Students can submit, TAs can grade

#### 1. Submissions Controller ⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Impact**: Unblocks student workflow

```typescript
// Needed endpoints:
POST /submissions          // Student submits assignment
PATCH /submissions/:id     // Update draft submission
DELETE /submissions/:id    // Delete incorrect submission

// Key features:
- File upload handling
- Status transitions (DRAFT → SUBMITTED)
- Validation (due date, assignment type)
- Reflection response creation
```

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours

#### 2. Grades Controller ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
**Impact**: Unblocks TA workflow

```typescript
// Needed endpoints:
POST /grades               // TA grades submission
PATCH /grades/:id          // Update grade (with GradeChange audit)

// Key features:
- Score validation (0 ≤ score ≤ maxScore)
- Grade history tracking
- Feedback text
- Automatic submission status update (SUBMITTED → GRADED)
```

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

#### 3. Comments Controller ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
**Impact**: Enables feedback loop

```typescript
// Needed endpoints:
GET /submissions/:id/comments    // View all comments
POST /submissions/:id/comments   // Add comment
POST /comments/:id/replies       // Reply to comment

// Key features:
- Threaded comments (parent/child)
- Markdown support
- Real-time updates (optional)
```

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Phase 1 Total**: 9-13 hours

---

### Phase 2: Complete Course Management (Week 2)
**Goal**: Professors can create and manage courses

#### 4. Courses Controller
```typescript
POST /courses              // Create course
PATCH /courses/:id         // Update course details
DELETE /courses/:id        // Delete course
```

#### 5. Enrollments Controller (NEW)
```typescript
GET /courses/:id/enrollments       // View enrolled users
POST /courses/:id/enrollments      // Enroll user in course
DELETE /enrollments/:id            // Remove enrollment

// Key features:
- Role-based enrollment (STUDENT, TA, PROFESSOR)
- Validation (no duplicate enrollments)
- Cascade handling (what happens to submissions?)
```

**Phase 2 Total**: 6-8 hours

---

### Phase 3: Reflection System (Week 3)
**Goal**: Implement unique reflection feature

#### 6. Reflection Templates Controller (NEW)
```typescript
GET /assignments/:id/template          // View reflection template
POST /assignments/:id/template         // Create reflection template
PATCH /templates/:id                   // Update template
DELETE /templates/:id                  // Delete template
```

#### 7. Reflection Responses Controller (NEW)
```typescript
GET /submissions/:id/reflection        // View reflection response
POST /submissions/:id/reflection       // Submit reflection
PATCH /reflections/:id                 // Update reflection
```

#### 8. Skill Tags Controller (NEW)
```typescript
GET /skill-tags                        // List all skills
POST /skill-tags                       // Create skill tag
PATCH /skill-tags/:id                  // Update skill
DELETE /skill-tags/:id                 // Delete skill
```

**Phase 3 Total**: 8-10 hours

---

### Phase 4: Testing Implementation (Week 4)
**Goal**: 80% test coverage

#### Backend Unit Tests
```bash
apps/api/src/**/*.spec.ts

# Target: 80% coverage
- Users service (auth sync, CRUD)
- Courses service (read operations)
- Assignments service (full CRUD)
- Submissions service (new CRUD)
- Grades service (new CRUD, audit trail)
- Guards (JWT validation, role-based)
```

**Time**: 10-12 hours

#### Frontend Component Tests
```bash
apps/web-start/src/**/*.test.tsx

# Key components:
- LoginButton (all auth states)
- RequireAuth guard
- Navigation (auth integration)
- Assignment list/detail
- Submission form
- Grade display
```

**Time**: 8-10 hours

#### E2E Tests (Playwright)
```bash
tests/e2e/**/*.spec.ts

# Critical user journeys:
- Complete login flow
- Student submits assignment
- TA grades submission
- Student views feedback
- Professor creates assignment
- Reflection completion flow
```

**Time**: 8-10 hours

**Phase 4 Total**: 26-32 hours

---

### Phase 5: Analytics & Admin (Week 5)
**Goal**: Enable administrative features

#### 9. Activity Logs Controller (NEW)
```typescript
GET /activity-logs             // View all activities
GET /users/:id/activity-logs   // User activity
GET /activity-logs/recent      // Dashboard widget
```

#### 10. Analytics Endpoints
```typescript
GET /courses/:id/analytics          // Grade distributions
GET /reflections/analytics          // Skill tag trends
GET /submissions/analytics          // Submission patterns
```

**Phase 5 Total**: 6-8 hours

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Distribution (Recommended)
```
Total Tests: 150-200 tests
├── Unit Tests: 70% (105-140 tests)
├── Integration Tests: 20% (30-40 tests)
└── E2E Tests: 10% (15-20 tests)
```

### Testing Tools
- **Backend**: Jest + Supertest
- **Frontend**: Vitest + Testing Library
- **E2E**: Playwright (best for Auth0)
- **API Mocking**: Mock Service Worker (MSW)

### Critical Test Scenarios

**Tier 1 (Must Have)**:
1. ✅ Authentication (login/logout/JWT)
2. ❌ Submission workflow (create → grade → view)
3. ❌ Grade creation with validation
4. ❌ Comment threading
5. ❌ Role-based access control

**Tier 2 (Important)**:
6. ❌ Course creation and enrollment
7. ❌ Reflection creation and submission
8. ❌ Grade updates with audit trail
9. ❌ File upload handling
10. ❌ Error handling and validation

## 🚀 Quick Start for Next Session

### To Continue Development:

1. **Start servers** (if not running):
   ```bash
   # From project root - starts both servers
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001

2. **Verify data is loaded**:
   - Login at http://localhost:3001
   - Navigate to `/courses`
   - Should see 3 courses with assignments

3. **Begin Phase 1** (Submissions CRUD):
   ```bash
   # Create controller
   cd apps/api
   npx nest g controller submissions --no-spec

   # Create service
   npx nest g service submissions --no-spec

   # Create DTOs
   mkdir -p src/submissions/dto
   touch src/submissions/dto/create-submission.dto.ts
   touch src/submissions/dto/update-submission.dto.ts
   ```

### Test Users (From Seed Data)
```

## 💡 Implementation Tips

### Best Practices to Follow
1. **DTOs for all endpoints** - Type safety and validation
2. **Service layer pattern** - Keep controllers thin
3. **Async/await** - All database operations
4. **Error handling** - Use NestJS exception filters
5. **Transaction support** - For multi-step operations
6. **Audit logging** - Track all mutations
7. **Test as you build** - Don't defer testing

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Hardcoded user IDs** - Use Auth0 context
2. **Missing guards** - All endpoints need `@UseGuards()`
3. **No validation** - Always validate input
4. **Circular imports** - Plan module dependencies
5. **N+1 queries** - Use Prisma includes
6. **Missing cascade deletes** - Define in schema
7. **No error boundaries** - Handle failures gracefully
