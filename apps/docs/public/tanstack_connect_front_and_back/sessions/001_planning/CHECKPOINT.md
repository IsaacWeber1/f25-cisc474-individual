# Checkpoint 001: Comprehensive Planning & Documentation

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Starting State**: New assignment - no documentation existed

---

## üö® MANDATORY PRE-CHECKPOINT CHECKLIST
- [x] **Updated CURRENT_STATE.md** with:
  - [x] Latest checkpoint number and date
  - [x] This checkpoint added to "Session History"
  - [x] Status indicators updated (Planning 100%, Implementation 0%)
  - [x] "Next Actions" updated for implementation phase
- [x] **Saved this checkpoint** to `sessions/001_planning/`

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Repository Analysis
- Explored existing codebase structure (apps/api, apps/web-start, packages/)
- Analyzed Prisma schema - identified 8+ entities (User, Course, Assignment, Submission, Grade, Reflection, Comment, SkillTag)
- Reviewed current backend implementation - confirmed only GET endpoints exist
- Examined frontend routes and components - confirmed read-only operations
- Identified `packages/api` exists but currently empty (ready for DTOs)

### 2. Comprehensive Implementation Plan Created
- Entity-by-entity analysis with priority matrix (Assignments highest, Comments lowest)
- Complete DTO schemas for all entities using Zod
- Backend service/controller patterns for CRUD operations
- Frontend form components and mutation hooks
- 5-phase implementation roadmap (Foundation ‚Üí Core ‚Üí Supporting ‚Üí Grading ‚Üí Advanced)
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
- File: `planning/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (121KB, 580+ lines)

### 3. Documentation Structure Reorganized
- Reorganized to follow regassist_project standards
- Created proper directory structure (planning/, architecture/, guides/, sessions/)
- Moved professor's assignment to `planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- Created README.md with quick overview
- Created CURRENT_STATE.md with "üî¥ NEXT SESSION START HERE" marker
- Created this checkpoint

### 4. Architecture Patterns Documented
- DTO design patterns (Response, List Item, Create, Update, Query)
- Shared infrastructure patterns (common helpers, mutation hooks, transformers)
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Error handling patterns
- Field categorization rules (what to include/exclude in DTOs)

## What I Verified Works

**Documentation Structure**:
```bash
ls -R apps/docs/public/tanstack_connect_front_and_back/
# Output shows proper structure:
#   README.md, CURRENT_STATE.md
#   planning/, architecture/, guides/, sessions/
```

**Files Readable**:
- Professor's requirements preserved in planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
- Comprehensive plan accessible in planning/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- All markdown renders correctly

---

## Files Changed

| File | Change | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `README.md` | Created | Overview with quick links |
| `CURRENT_STATE.md` | Created | Living status document with handoff marker |
| `planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` | Moved (was assignment.md) | Professor's assignment requirements |
| `planning/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | Moved (was COMPREHENSIVE_PLANNING.md) | Full implementation guide |
| `sessions/001_planning/CHECKPOINT.md` | Created | This checkpoint |

**Summary**: 5 files created/reorganized, proper structure established

## Current System State

### Repository Status
- **Dev servers**: Not running (documentation-only session)
- **Git status**: Documentation changes uncommitted
- **Branch**: `main` (local)
- **Backend**: Has GET-only endpoints, needs POST/PATCH/DELETE
- **Frontend**: Read-only UI, needs forms and mutations
- **DTOs**: None exist yet

### How to Verify This Checkpoint
```bash
cd "/Users/owner/Assignments/Advanced Web Tech/f25-cisc474-individual"
ls apps/docs/public/tanstack_connect_front_and_back/
# Should show: README.md, CURRENT_STATE.md, planning/, architecture/, guides/, sessions/

cat apps/docs/public/tanstack_connect_front_and_back/CURRENT_STATE.md
# Should show "üî¥ NEXT SESSION START HERE" with clear next actions
```

**Expected Output**: Proper directory structure with all planning documents accessible

---

## Known Issues / Blockers

None - Planning complete, ready for implementation

---

## üî¥ Session Handoff

**What's Actually Working**:
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation structure created
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive implementation plan covers all entities
- ‚úÖ DTO patterns defined with Zod schemas
- ‚úÖ Clear priority matrix (Assignments ‚Üí Courses ‚Üí Submissions ‚Üí ...)
- ‚úÖ 5-phase roadmap with time estimates
- ‚úÖ Testing strategy defined
- ‚úÖ Following regassist_project standards

**What's NOT Done** (despite docs/planning):
- ‚ùå No actual code written yet
- ‚ùå Zod not installed
- ‚ùå No DTOs created in packages/api
- ‚ùå Backend services lack CRUD methods
- ‚ùå Frontend has no forms
- ‚ùå No mutation hooks implemented

**Next Session Must**:
1. Install Zod: `cd packages/api && npm install zod`
2. Create `packages/api/src/assignments.ts` with DTO schemas
3. Implement backend CRUD in `apps/api/src/assignments/`
4. Test endpoints with curl/Postman
5. Update CURRENT_STATE.md after Phase 2 complete

**Critical Context**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Assignment requirement: Minimum = Assignments CRUD only (4-6 hours)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional: Full system = All entities (20-30 hours)
- üìã Priority: Start with Assignments (highest priority, meets requirement)
- üìã Pattern established: Every entity follows same DTO pattern
- üìã Current user ID hardcoded: `cmfr0jaxg0001k07ao6mvl0d2` (from constants.ts)

## üö® FINAL REMINDER

**Did you update CURRENT_STATE.md?** ‚úÖ YES

Check "MANDATORY PRE-CHECKPOINT CHECKLIST" ‚Üë

---

*Next session: Read CURRENT_STATE.md first, then start Phase 2 implementation.*
