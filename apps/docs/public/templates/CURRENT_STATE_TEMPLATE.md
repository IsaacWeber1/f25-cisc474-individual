<!--
⚠️ KEEP THIS FILE CONCISE - TARGET: UNDER 150 LINES
This is a HANDOFF document, not documentation.
Details belong in checkpoints and architecture docs.

DO NOT INCLUDE:
- Code examples (put in architecture docs)
- Detailed explanations (put in checkpoints)
- Implementation steps (put in planning docs)
- Long-form analysis (put in checkpoints)
- Prescriptive "next actions" or numbered phases (micromanagement)

ONLY INCLUDE:
- Current status snapshot
- What's done/working (bullets: ONE LINE each)
- What's not working/known issues (bullets: ONE LINE each)
- Work remaining (unordered checklist, can be grouped by category)
- Links to detailed docs

Principle: MANY ITEMS OK, VERBOSE ITEMS NOT OK
Work remaining can be ordered by priority/logic, but NOT numbered phases
-->

- [Another working component]
- [Script/workflow that's functional]

## Known Issues

## Work Remaining

<!-- Ordered by priority or logical flow, but keep as checkboxes for flexibility. -->
<!-- Next session determines what to tackle, not prescriptive phases. -->

<!--
✅ FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE SAVING:
- Is this file concise? Target: under 150 lines (check: wc -l CURRENT_STATE.md)
- Are all bullets ONE LINE each?
- Are all code examples removed? (they belong in architecture/)
- Are all detailed explanations removed? (they belong in checkpoints/)
- Did you update "Last Updated" with latest session?
- Did you add items to Work Remaining, NOT prescriptive phases/next actions?
- Is Work Remaining an unordered stack (checkboxes, not numbered)?

Remember: This is a HANDOFF, not DOCUMENTATION.
Many items OK. Verbose items NOT OK.
Work stack OK. Prescriptive phases NOT OK.
