# Learning Management System (LMS) Planning Document

**Vision:**  
To create a flexible, user-friendly, and scalable Learning Management System that empowers learners, instructors, and administrators by providing a structured yet adaptable environment for managing programming problems structured around courses, assignments, submissions, and feedback. The LMS will support diverse learning needs, streamline administrative processes, and foster meaningful engagement between all roles in the system.  
A unique feature of this LMS will be **interactive coding submission types**, where students can submit runnable code snippets with embedded test cases that professors/teaching assistants can execute directly within the LMS.
