## 📝 Session History

### Session 003: Cloudflare Deployment Complete (2025-10-11)
**FINAL SESSION** - Successfully deployed to Cloudflare Workers with all fixes applied. Fixed 4 nested routing issues: missing Outlet, null safety, nested layouts, and conditional rendering. All 13 pages verified working in production.
**Checkpoint**: [`sessions/003_cloudflare_deployment/CHECKPOINT.md`](sessions/003_cloudflare_deployment/CHECKPOINT.md) ← **LATEST**

### Session 002: Analysis Complete (2025-10-11)
**Major Discovery**: Upstream merge not needed! Your implementation already exceeds instructor's minimal TanStack. You have Cloudflare configured identically. Only question: Is your advanced schema acceptable? If yes, just deploy. If no, would require 10-20 hours to adopt their simpler schema.
**Checkpoint**: [`sessions/002_analysis_complete/CHECKPOINT.md`](sessions/002_analysis_complete/CHECKPOINT.md)

### Session 001: Initialization (2025-10-11)
Created feature structure and planning repository following regassist checkpoint system. Identified scope: merge 19 upstream commits while preserving working TanStack implementation, migrate to Cloudflare Workers.
**Checkpoint**: [`sessions/001_initialization/CHECKPOINT.md`](sessions/001_initialization/CHECKPOINT.md)
