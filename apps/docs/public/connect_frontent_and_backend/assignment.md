Use the fetch function to access data from your backend API and render it on the Frontend. At least two backend routes should be accessible in this way.

You will need to make client components to render your data. Use the Suspense approach to provide a visual fallback while the data loads.

Deploy your changes. You will need to correctly configure CORS for your backend; you may not use the wildcard for GET requests! Correctly configure your backend to recognize your frontend. I recommend using environment variables for informing both sides about the other.

Make sure there is an accessible page that links to at least two pages that access data in your backend. Clearly identify both urls, so we know what to click to visually confirm that you are correctly loading data from your backend in your frontend. Submit the link to that frontend page.
